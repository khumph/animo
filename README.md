#### Abstract
> Background: Hispanic males have the highest rates of overweight and obesity compared to males of other racial/ethnic groups. While weight loss can significantly reduce obesity related health risks, Hispanic males are grossly underrepresented in weight loss research. Our work addresses a critical gap by informing how tailored intervention strategies improve weight management in this health disparate population. <br>
> Purpose: This pilot randomized controlled study compared a 12-week gender- and culturally-sensitive weight loss intervention (GCSWLI) to a waist-list control (WLC) in sedentary, overweight/obese Hispanic males. <br>
> Methods: Fifty Hispanic males (age: 43 ± 11 years; BMI: 34 ± 5 kg/m²; 58% Spanish monolingual) were randomized to one of two groups:  GCSWLI (n=25) or WLC (n=25). GCSWLI participants attended weekly in-person individual sessions guided by a trained bilingual Hispanic male lifestyle coach, were prescribed a daily reduced calorie goal with a specific focus on reducing/modifying the types of food and liquids consumed (e.g., alcohol/sugar sweetened beverages), and 225 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity (PA) per week. Additional GCSWLI features included a free gym membership and optional spouse/significant other attendance at intervention sessions. The WLC were asked to maintain their usual dietary intake and PA habits during the 12 weeks. GCSWLI participants continued with 12 weeks of follow-up including bi-weekly phone calls. Estimates of weight lost were obtained using a linear mixed effects model with categorical time and random intercepts.
> Results: Between June-August 2016, 143 men expressed interest in participation; 35% (n=50) completed baseline measures and were randomized. Forty-three of 50 participants completed 12-week assessments, an overall attrition rate of 14% (GCSWLI: n=5, 20% vs. WLC: n=2, 8%). At week 12, using intention-to-treat, the mean weight loss in the GCSWLI was -6.3 kg (95% CI [-8.4, -4.1]) compared to -0.8 kg (95% CI [-2.8, 1.2]) for WLC (difference = -5.5 kg, 95% CI [-7.6, -3.4], p < 0.001). At week 24, weight loss in the GCSWLI was maintained (-6.4 kg, 95% CI [-8.6, -4.3]). <br>
> Conclusion: The GCSWLI appears to be a feasible strategy to engage Hispanic males in weight loss/management. Our pilot study indicates preliminary evidence of efficacy, though due to the small sample size, confirmation of these findings are needed in a larger study. <br>
