For the percent weight, I log transformed the weight then back transformed, so I do an analogous (and superfluous) operation here.

```{r, message=F}
library(tidyverse)
animo <- read_csv("animo.csv")

animo %>% select(participant_id, group, week, weight) %>%
  spread(key = week, value = weight) %>%
  group_by(group) %>%
  summarise(sd(`12` - `0`, na.rm = T), # SD of change from baseline
            sd((exp(log(`12`/`0`)) -  1) * 100, na.rm = T), # SD of pct change from baseline
            cor(`12`, `0`, use = "complete")) # correlation between week 12 and baseline
```
